# Customer Churn Prediction Project
The objective is to predict whether a customer will change telecommunications provider ("churning"). For telecommunications companies in markets with strong competition, it is key to be able to classify customers in order to predict which ones are likely to cancel service. Based on these estimates, commercial strategies for customer retention can be developed. Modules used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow.
